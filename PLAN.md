# UEMCP Implementation Plan & Release Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation roadmap, release schedule, and future development plans for the Unreal Engine Model Context Protocol (UEMCP) server.

## Current Status

UEMCP is a mature, production-ready system with **30+ working MCP tools** and comprehensive error handling. All core functionality is implemented and tested.

## Release Roadmap

### âœ… Version 0.8.0 (Current)
**Theme: "Blueprint Integration & Enhanced Workflows"**

#### Recently Completed
- âœ… Blueprint creation tool (blueprint_create)
- âœ… Undo/Redo system (undo, redo, history_list, checkpoint_create, checkpoint_restore)
- âœ… Enhanced error handling framework
- âœ… Fixed batch_spawn critical indentation bug
- âœ… Fixed TypeScript command routing issues
- âœ… Comprehensive validation suite improvements

### ðŸš€ Version 0.9.0 - "Performance & Reliability"
**Target: Production-Ready Performance**

#### Core Objectives
- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - [ ] Advanced asset caching system
  - [ ] Optimized batch operations for 1000+ actors
  - [ ] Improved viewport management during bulk operations
  - [ ] Memory usage optimization for long-running sessions

- [ ] **Enhanced Testing & Reliability** 
  - [ ] Integration test coverage > 90%
  - [ ] Stress testing with large scenes (10,000+ actors)
  - [ ] Load testing (100+ operations/minute)
  - [ ] Cross-platform validation (Windows, macOS, Linux)

- [ ] **Production Deployment**
  - [ ] Docker container with optimized configuration
  - [ ] Production deployment documentation
  - [ ] Multi-project workspace support
  - [ ] Enhanced logging and monitoring

### ðŸŽ¯ Version 1.0.0 - "Production Release"
**Target: Enterprise-Ready Solution**

#### 1.0.0 Success Criteria
- âœ… **Core Functionality Complete** - 30+ working MCP tools
- âœ… **Architecture Stable** - Production-ready TypeScript/Python bridge
- [ ] **Performance Optimized** - Sub-second response for 95% of operations
- [ ] **Thoroughly Tested** - >90% integration test coverage
- [ ] **Well Documented** - Complete API docs and tutorials
- [ ] **Community Adopted** - Used in 10+ production projects

## Current Architecture Status

**âœ… Production-Ready Foundation:**
- **MCP Server**: Modular TypeScript implementation with 30+ tools
- **UE Plugin**: Content-only (no C++ compilation required)
- **Python Bridge**: HTTP listener on port 8765 with hot reload support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive framework with meaningful messages
- **Testing**: Automated CI/CD pipeline with diagnostic validation

**âœ… Recently Fixed Critical Issues:**
- **batch_spawn indentation bug**: Fixed NoneType subscript error (PR #45)
- **TypeScript command routing**: Fixed actor.batch_spawn â†’ actor_batch_spawn
- **actor_modify validation**: Fixed optional parameter handling
- **restart_listener stability**: Eliminated crashes and deadlocks

## 0.9.0 Priority Tasks

### 1. Performance Optimization (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current Issues Identified:**
- Individual actor operations require separate HTTP requests
- Asset loading happens per-actor in batch operations  
- Placement validation has O(nÂ²) complexity
- No asset caching or pre-loading optimization

**Implementation Plan:**
- [ ] **Asset Caching System**: Cache frequently used assets to reduce load times
- [ ] **Batch Operation Optimization**: Group multiple operations into single HTTP requests
- [ ] **Viewport Management**: Improve viewport disabling/enabling for bulk operations
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Optimize memory usage for long-running sessions

### 2. Enhanced Testing & Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)  
**Target Metrics:**
- [ ] Integration test coverage >90% (currently ~70%)
- [ ] Stress test with 10,000+ actor scenes
- [ ] Load test at 100+ operations per minute
- [ ] Cross-platform validation (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### 3. Production Deployment (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Docker container with optimized configuration
- [ ] Production deployment documentation
- [ ] Enhanced logging and monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Multi-project workspace support

## Success Metrics for 0.9.0

**Performance Targets:**
- [ ] Sub-second response time for 95% of operations
- [ ] Handle 1000+ actor batch operations efficiently  
- [ ] Memory usage stable over 8+ hour sessions
- [ ] Asset loading time reduced by 50% through caching

**Reliability Targets:**
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in core operations
- [ ] 99%+ success rate for standard operations
- [ ] Graceful handling of all error conditions
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging and diagnostics

**Testing Targets:**
- [ ] Integration test coverage >90%
- [ ] Stress tested with 10,000+ actor scenes
- [ ] Cross-platform validation (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Load tested at 100+ operations per minute

## Post-0.9.0 Future Considerations

**1.0.0 and Beyond:**
- Advanced level composition tools (level streaming, world partition)
- Animation and sequencer integration 
- AI-powered asset generation pipeline
- Community ecosystem development

## Development Principles for 0.9.0

1. **Performance First**: Optimize for speed and memory efficiency
2. **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive testing before feature completion
3. **User Experience**: Clear error messages and reliable operations
4. **Documentation**: Keep implementation docs updated
5. **MCP-First**: Prefer dedicated tools over python_proxy workarounds

## Next Steps

1. **Complete performance analysis and optimization implementation**
2. **Expand test coverage to >90%** 
3. **Implement production deployment features**
4. **Prepare for 1.0.0 release candidate**

---

**UEMCP Status**: Production-ready with 30+ tools, comprehensive error handling, and stable architecture. Ready for performance optimization phase leading to 1.0.0 release.
