## Recommendation

Based on addressing current limitations and user pain points, I recommend prioritizing development in this order:

### 1. âœ… **Socket-Based Placement System** (COMPLETED in v0.7.0)
Successfully implemented the `actor_snap_to_socket` tool which eliminates manual coordinate calculations for modular building.

### 2. **Option B: Undo/Redo System** (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)
The lack of undo is a critical usability issue that affects user confidence. Implementation would:
- Allow safe experimentation
- Reduce fear of making mistakes
- Enable complex iterative workflows
- Improve overall user experience

### 3. **Option C: Blueprint Tools** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
While Blueprint graph editing remains a limitation, the ability to create and configure Blueprints would:
- Enable interactive elements (doors, switches, triggers)
- Support gameplay mechanics
- Complement our building tools with functionality

### 4. **Option G: AI-Generated 3D Asset Pipeline** (FUTURE CONSIDERATION)
The AI asset pipeline could be transformative but requires significant infrastructure:
- Needs local GPU and ComfyUI setup
- Complex integration work
- Best suited for users with existing AI workflows

**Immediate Next Steps**: Focus on Socket-Based Placement System as it addresses a critical limitation, builds on existing work, and provides immediate value to users doing modular building.

## Implementation Priority

### For Socket-Based Placement System (Recommended):
1. **actor_snap_to_socket** - Core socket alignment functionality
2. **actor_align** - Multi-actor alignment based on sockets
3. **socket_preview** - Visual feedback for available connections
4. **socket_connect** - Advanced multi-socket connections
5. **socket_validate** - Verify proper socket connections

### For Undo/Redo System:
1. **Operation history storage** - Track all MCP operations
2. **undo** - Basic single operation undo
3. **redo** - Redo functionality
4. **checkpoint_create/restore** - Save points for complex operations
5. **history_list** - View and manage operation history

### For Blueprint Tools:
1. **blueprint_create** - Foundation for all other Blueprint operations
2. **blueprint_add_component** - Essential for actor composition
3. **blueprint_set_variable** - Enable data-driven Blueprints
4. **blueprint_create_event** - Add interactivity
5. **blueprint_compile** - Ensure changes take effect

## Technical Considerations

### For Blueprint Tools:
- Blueprint manipulation requires careful handling of the UE reflection system
- Need to ensure proper compilation and validation after modifications
- Should provide templates for common patterns (door, switch, trigger, etc.)
- Must handle Blueprint inheritance chains correctly

### For AI Asset Pipeline with ComfyUI:
- Requires ComfyUI server running with API enabled: `python main.py --enable-cors-header`
- GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (16GB recommended for best quality models)
- ComfyUI-3D-Pack installation with model weights downloaded
- Workflow files (.json) for different generation tasks
- WebSocket connection for progress monitoring
- Result polling system for long-running operations
- Proper error handling for ComfyUI node failures
- Consider implementing workflow templates for common asset types

## Development Principles

1. **MCP-First**: Always prefer dedicated tools over python_proxy workarounds
2. **User Experience**: Clear error messages and intuitive APIs
3. **Performance**: Optimize for common workflows
4. **Maintainability**: Modular architecture with comprehensive tests
5. **Documentation**: Keep docs in sync with implementation

## Success Metrics

- **Tool Coverage**: 90%+ of common editor operations available as MCP tools
- **Performance**: Sub-second response time for most operations
- **Reliability**: 99%+ success rate for standard operations
- **Developer Experience**: New contributors can add tools in < 1 hour
- **User Satisfaction**: AI assistants can complete complex tasks without manual intervention
