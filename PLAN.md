- **Full bidirectional communication** between Claude and UE
- **25 working MCP tools** organized by category
- **Hot reload support** via `restart_listener()`
- **Comprehensive error handling** and diagnostics
- **CI/CD pipeline** with automated testing

### Recently Completed Tools (Phase 5)

1. âœ… **Enhanced asset_info** - Comprehensive bounds, pivot, socket, and collision data
2. âœ… **batch_spawn** - Efficient multi-actor spawning with 4-5x performance improvement
3. âœ… **placement_validate** - Gap/overlap detection for modular building validation
4. âœ… **asset_import** - FAB marketplace and local asset import with advanced settings

## Phase 6: Next Development Options

Based on our house building experiment and current capabilities, here are the next potential development phases:

### Option A: Blueprint Tools
**Objective**: Enable programmatic creation and modification of Blueprint classes

**New MCP Tools**:
1. **blueprint_create** - Create new Blueprint classes from C++ or Blueprint parents
2. **blueprint_add_component** - Add components to Blueprint actors
3. **blueprint_set_variable** - Create and modify Blueprint variables
4. **blueprint_add_function** - Add custom functions with parameters
5. **blueprint_create_event_graph** - Set up event-driven logic

**Use Cases**:
- Create interactive doors/windows with open/close functionality
- Build reusable gameplay mechanics
- Set up trigger volumes with custom events
- Create UI widgets programmatically

### Option B: Material & Rendering Tools
**Objective**: Dynamic material creation and modification

**New MCP Tools**:
1. **material_create_instance** - Create material instances from parent materials
2. **material_set_parameter** - Modify scalar/vector/texture parameters
3. **material_apply_to_actor** - Apply materials to specific actors/components
4. **render_settings_modify** - Adjust post-processing and rendering settings

**Use Cases**:
- Change building colors/textures dynamically
- Create weather effects (wet surfaces, snow accumulation)
- Adjust lighting mood and atmosphere
- Optimize material usage across many actors

### Option C: Level & World Composition Tools
**Objective**: Advanced level management and world building

**New MCP Tools**:
1. **level_create** - Create new levels/sublevels
2. **level_stream** - Set up level streaming volumes
3. **world_partition_setup** - Configure world partition settings
4. **landscape_sculpt** - Basic landscape modification tools
5. **foliage_paint** - Procedural foliage placement

**Use Cases**:
- Create large open worlds with streaming
- Organize complex projects into sublevels
- Set up interior/exterior transitions
- Build natural environments

### Option D: Animation & Sequencer Tools
**Objective**: Create cinematics and animated sequences

**New MCP Tools**:
1. **sequencer_create** - Create new level sequences
2. **sequencer_add_track** - Add animation tracks for actors
3. **camera_animate** - Create camera movements and cuts
4. **sequencer_export** - Export cinematics as video

**Use Cases**:
- Create architectural walkthroughs
- Build cutscenes for games
- Animate doors, elevators, moving platforms
- Generate marketing videos of levels

### Option E: Physics & Simulation Tools
**Objective**: Add physics-based interactions and simulations

**New MCP Tools**:
1. **physics_enable** - Enable physics simulation on actors
2. **constraint_create** - Create physics constraints between actors
3. **destructible_setup** - Configure destructible meshes
4. **physics_simulate** - Run physics simulations

**Use Cases**:
- Create destructible environments
- Build physics puzzles
- Simulate structural integrity
- Add realistic object interactions

## Recommendation

Based on user needs and maximum impact, I recommend proceeding with **Option A: Blueprint Tools** as the next phase. This would:

1. Enable creation of interactive elements (doors, switches, triggers)
2. Allow building reusable gameplay systems
3. Provide the foundation for more complex automation
4. Have high value for both architectural visualization and game development

The Blueprint tools would complement our existing building tools perfectly, allowing users to not just build structures but make them interactive and functional.

## Implementation Priority

If we proceed with Blueprint tools, here's the recommended implementation order:

1. **blueprint_create** - Foundation for all other Blueprint operations
2. **blueprint_add_component** - Essential for actor composition
3. **blueprint_set_variable** - Enable data-driven Blueprints
4. **blueprint_create_event** - Add interactivity
5. **blueprint_compile** - Ensure changes take effect

## Technical Considerations

- Blueprint manipulation requires careful handling of the UE reflection system
- Need to ensure proper compilation and validation after modifications
- Should provide templates for common patterns (door, switch, trigger, etc.)
- Must handle Blueprint inheritance chains correctly

## Development Principles

1. **MCP-First**: Always prefer dedicated tools over python_proxy workarounds
2. **User Experience**: Clear error messages and intuitive APIs
3. **Performance**: Optimize for common workflows
4. **Maintainability**: Modular architecture with comprehensive tests
5. **Documentation**: Keep docs in sync with implementation

## Success Metrics

- **Tool Coverage**: 90%+ of common editor operations available as MCP tools
- **Performance**: Sub-second response time for most operations
- **Reliability**: 99%+ success rate for standard operations
- **Developer Experience**: New contributors can add tools in < 1 hour
- **User Satisfaction**: AI assistants can complete complex tasks without manual intervention
