---

### **Phase 2: Base Class Testing (Medium Impact) - FUTURE**  
**Target Coverage**: Base classes 40% → 70%

#### **BaseTool Enhanced Tests**
```typescript
// Focus on business logic not covered by tool-specific tests:
- Error handling patterns and error message formatting
- Validation pipeline execution and result aggregation  
- Tool execution lifecycle and logging integration
- Response formatting consistency across tool types
```

#### **ActorTool, AssetTool, ViewportTool Tests**  
```typescript
// Focus on shared behaviors and inheritance patterns:
- Common parameter validation logic
- Shared response formatting patterns  
- Error handling inheritance and customization
- Tool-specific validation logic consistency
```

### **Phase 3: Error Handling & Edge Cases (High Reliability Value)**
**Target**: Comprehensive error path coverage

#### **Error Scenarios Testing**
```typescript
// High-value resilience tests:
- Network failures and connection loss scenarios
- Invalid parameter handling across tool types
- Python bridge communication failures and recovery  
- Malformed response handling and graceful degradation
- Resource cleanup during error conditions
```

#### **Edge Case Coverage**
```typescript
// Boundary condition tests:
- Extreme parameter values (very large numbers, negative values)
- Unicode and special character handling in paths/names
- Concurrent operation handling and race conditions
- Memory pressure and resource exhaustion scenarios  
```

### **Phase 4: Business Logic Validation (Medium Value)**
**Target**: Algorithm and formatting logic coverage

#### **Response Formatting Logic**
```typescript
// Algorithm tests (not just mock validation):
- Asset information processing and formatting logic
- Validation result aggregation and prioritization
- Error message construction and context inclusion
- Response structure consistency and completeness
```

#### **Validation Pipeline Logic**
```typescript  
// Business rule tests:
- Parameter validation algorithm correctness
- Cross-parameter validation logic (e.g., location + rotation consistency)  
- Validation result combination and conflict resolution
- Warning vs. error classification logic
```

### **Implementation Strategy**

#### **High-Value Focus Areas:**
1. **Service Layer** (biggest coverage impact, tests core infrastructure)
2. **Error Handling** (highest reliability value, tests system resilience)  
3. **Business Logic** (tests algorithms independent of external systems)

#### **What to AVOID (Low-Value Testing):**
❌ Static mock response validation (already covered by integration tests)  
❌ External library behavior testing (Jest, MCP SDK, Node.js APIs)
❌ HTTP serialization/deserialization (covered by SDK)
❌ File system operations (covered by Node.js)

#### **Testing Principles:**
✅ **Test Business Logic**: Algorithms, validation, formatting, categorization  
✅ **Test Error Handling**: Edge cases, failures, recovery patterns
✅ **Test State Management**: Configuration, registry, lifecycle management
✅ **Test Integration Patterns**: How components work together (not external APIs)

#### **Coverage Goals by Area:**
- **Service Layer**: 0% → 80% (highest impact)
- **Base Classes**: 40% → 70% (medium impact, focus on uncovered logic)  
- **Utilities**: 71% → 85% (polish existing well-tested code)
- **Global Coverage**: 2.74% → 15%+ (realistic improvement target)

#### **Success Metrics:**
- [ ] Service layer core functionality has comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Error handling paths are validated for all critical operations
- [ ] Business logic algorithms have independent test validation  
- [ ] CI coverage thresholds can be incrementally increased
- [ ] Test suite provides meaningful failure detection (not just mock validation)


#### Marketplace Readiness (Minimal)
- [ ] **Submission Prep**
  - [ ] UE Marketplace compliance check
  - [ ] License validation

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Testing complexity**: Mock UE environment creation → Mitigate with incremental approach
- **Cross-platform issues**: Platform-specific bugs → Early CI setup and continuous testing
- **Performance regression**: New features impact speed → Continuous benchmarking

### Timeline Risks  
- **Scope creep**: Feature additions delay release → Strict must-have/should-have gates
- **Resource constraints**: Limited development time → Focus on blocking requirements first
- **External dependencies**: UE updates, marketplace approval → Build buffer time

### Market Risks
- **Competition**: Other automation tools → Focus on unique MCP advantages and quality
- **Adoption barriers**: Complex setup → Prioritize documentation and ease of use
- **Community building**: Low initial engagement → Invest in showcase projects and tutorials
