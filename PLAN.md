  - âœ… Batch operations framework (80-90% HTTP overhead reduction)
  - âœ… Memory management system for long-running sessions
  - âœ… Viewport optimization during bulk operations
  - âœ… Instance caching for operation efficiency
  - âœ… Upfront validation framework (eliminated try/except patterns)

### ðŸš€ Version 1.0.0 - "Production Release" (In Progress)
**Target: Enterprise-Ready Solution**

#### Remaining Objectives
- [ ] **Enhanced Testing & Reliability** 
  - [ ] Integration test coverage > 90%
  - [ ] Stress testing with large scenes (10,000+ actors)
  - [ ] Load testing (100+ operations/minute)
  - [ ] Cross-platform validation (Windows, macOS, Linux)

- [ ] **Production Deployment**
  - [ ] Docker container with optimized configuration
  - [ ] Production deployment documentation
  - [ ] Multi-project workspace support
  - [ ] Enhanced logging and monitoring

#### 1.0.0 Success Criteria
- âœ… **Core Functionality Complete** - 31 working MCP tools
- âœ… **Architecture Stable** - Production-ready TypeScript/Python bridge
- âœ… **Performance Optimized** - Comprehensive performance suite implemented
- [ ] **Thoroughly Tested** - >90% integration test coverage
- [ ] **Well Documented** - Complete API docs and tutorials
- [ ] **Community Adopted** - Used in 10+ production projects

## Current Architecture Status

**âœ… Production-Ready Foundation:**
- **MCP Server**: Modular TypeScript implementation with 31 tools
- **UE Plugin**: Content-only (no C++ compilation required)
- **Python Bridge**: HTTP listener on port 8765 with hot reload support
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive framework with meaningful messages
- **Performance Suite**: Batch operations, memory management, viewport optimization
- **Testing**: Automated CI/CD pipeline with diagnostic validation

**âœ… Recently Completed Major Work:**
- **Performance optimization suite**: Comprehensive performance improvements (PR #47)
- **Batch operations framework**: 80-90% reduction in HTTP overhead 
- **Memory management system**: Long-running session optimization
- **Viewport optimization**: Bulk operation performance improvements
- **batch_spawn indentation bug**: Fixed NoneType subscript error (PR #45)
- **TypeScript command routing**: Fixed actor.batch_spawn â†’ actor_batch_spawn
- **actor_modify validation**: Fixed optional parameter handling
- **restart_listener stability**: Eliminated crashes and deadlocks

## 1.0.0 Priority Tasks

### 1. Enhanced Testing & Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)  
**Target Metrics:**
- [ ] Integration test coverage >90% (currently ~70%)
- [ ] Stress test with 10,000+ actor scenes
- [ ] Load test at 100+ operations per minute
- [ ] Cross-platform validation (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### 2. Production Deployment (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Docker container with optimized configuration
- [ ] Production deployment documentation
- [ ] Enhanced logging and monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Multi-project workspace support

### 3. Documentation & Community (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Tutorial series for common workflows
- [ ] Community project showcase
- [ ] Plugin marketplace submission

## Success Metrics for 1.0.0

**Performance Targets (âœ… Completed):**
- âœ… Sub-second response time for 95% of operations
- âœ… Handle 1000+ actor batch operations efficiently  
- âœ… Memory usage stable over 8+ hour sessions
- âœ… HTTP overhead reduced by 80-90% through batch operations

**Reliability Targets:**
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in core operations
- [ ] 99%+ success rate for standard operations
- [ ] Graceful handling of all error conditions
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging and diagnostics

**Testing Targets:**
- [ ] Integration test coverage >90%
- [ ] Stress tested with 10,000+ actor scenes
- [ ] Cross-platform validation (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Load tested at 100+ operations per minute

## Post-1.0.0 Future Considerations

**Version 2.0.0 and Beyond:**
- Advanced level composition tools (level streaming, world partition)
- Animation and sequencer integration 
- AI-powered asset generation pipeline
- Community ecosystem development
- Advanced Blueprint debugging and profiling tools
- VR/AR editor integration

## Development Principles for 1.0.0

1. **Testing First**: Comprehensive test coverage before 1.0.0 release
2. **Production Ready**: Docker deployment and monitoring capabilities
3. **User Experience**: Clear documentation and reliable operations
4. **Community Driven**: Enable community contributions and showcase projects
5. **MCP-First**: Continue preferring dedicated tools over python_proxy workarounds

## Next Steps (Updated for 1.0.0)

1. **Expand test coverage to >90%** (highest priority)
2. **Implement production deployment features**
3. **Create comprehensive documentation and tutorials**
4. **Prepare for 1.0.0 production release**

---

**UEMCP Status**: Production-ready with 31 tools, comprehensive error handling, performance optimization suite, and stable architecture. Ready for final testing and documentation phase leading to 1.0.0 release.
