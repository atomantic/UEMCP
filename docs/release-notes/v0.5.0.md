# UEMCP v0.5.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** July 31, 2024  
**Theme:** Major Architecture Refactor & Documentation

## 🎉 Overview

Version 0.5.0 represents a major architectural refactoring of UEMCP, transforming it from a monolithic structure to a modular, maintainable codebase with comprehensive documentation.

## ✨ Major Features

### 📚 Documentation Overhaul

Created comprehensive documentation for real-world usage:

- **`docs/house-building-experiment.md`** - Detailed learnings from building experiments
- **`docs/python-api-workarounds.md`** - Solutions for common UE Python API limitations
- **Known Limitations section in README** - Clear documentation of constraints with workarounds

### 🔧 Dynamic Tool Registry

Replaced hardcoded enum with automatic tool discovery:
- Tools are now automatically discovered at runtime
- Easier to add new tools without modifying core code
- Better maintainability and extensibility

### 📁 actor_organize Tool

New tool for organizing actors in the World Outliner:

```javascript
actor_organize({
  folder: "Building/Walls",
  pattern: "Wall_*"  // Organize all walls
})
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Major Server Refactor

**Before:** Monolithic server structure with all tools in one file  
**After:** Modularized architecture with category-based organization

- Separated tools into logical directories:
  - `actors/` - Actor manipulation tools
  - `viewport/` - Camera and viewport controls
  - `assets/` - Asset management
  - `level/` - Level operations
  - `system/` - System utilities
- Introduced base classes for common patterns
- **Result:** 85% code reduction when using dedicated tools vs python_proxy

### Python Plugin Reorganization

Restructured the Python plugin for better maintainability:

- Moved operation modules to `ops/` directory
- Moved utilities to `utils/` directory  
- Proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files
- Consistent import paths throughout

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Viewport Tools**: Fixed runtime errors in viewport_focus and other viewport methods
- **Import Path Issues**: Resolved all Python import inconsistencies
- **ESLint Compliance**: Fixed all TypeScript linting errors
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: All tests now pass consistently

## 🧹 Cleanup

### Removed Outdated Code
- Migration artifacts from modular conversion (5 files, ~3000 lines)
- Outdated `uemcp_bridge.py` with non-existent MCP commands
- Unused command categorization system from Python listener
- 1000+ lines of outdated content from PLAN.md

### Simplified Systems
- Streamlined status endpoint
- Removed unused command categorization
- Cleaned up redundant code paths

## 📊 Statistics

- **Code Reduction:** 85% less code needed for common operations
- **Files Removed:** 7 outdated files
- **Lines Removed:** ~4000 lines of legacy code
- **Documentation Added:** 3 major new docs

## 🔄 Migration from Earlier Versions

No breaking changes for end users. Internal architecture changes are transparent to MCP tool usage.
