# UEMCP v0.9.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** September 2025  
**Theme:** Performance & Reliability - Production-Ready Performance

## üéâ Overview

Version 0.9.0 delivers comprehensive performance optimizations, making UEMCP production-ready for large-scale Unreal Engine automation. This release introduces batch operations that reduce HTTP overhead by 80-90%, advanced memory management for long-running sessions, and viewport optimization during bulk operations.

## ‚ú® Major Features

### ‚ö° Batch Operations Framework

The new `batch_operations` tool enables executing multiple operations in a single HTTP request:

```javascript
// Execute multiple operations in one request
batch_operations({
  operations: [
    {
      operation: "actor_spawn",
      params: { assetPath: "/Game/Meshes/Wall", location: [0, 0, 0] },
      id: "wall_1"
    },
    {
      operation: "actor_spawn", 
      params: { assetPath: "/Game/Meshes/Wall", location: [300, 0, 0] },
      id: "wall_2"
    },
    {
      operation: "viewport_camera",
      params: { location: [150, -500, 300], rotation: [0, -30, 0] },
      id: "set_camera"
    }
  ]
})
```

**Performance Benefits:**
- **80-90% reduction** in HTTP overhead for multi-operation workflows
- Single network round-trip instead of N individual requests
- Efficient batch processing with detailed operation results
- Perfect for building automation and level design scripts

**Supported Operations:**
- `actor_spawn`, `actor_modify`, `actor_delete`, `actor_duplicate`
- `viewport_camera`, `viewport_screenshot`
- Comprehensive error tracking per operation

### üß† Memory Management System

Automatic memory optimization for long-running sessions:

```javascript
// Memory management works automatically, but can be configured
configure_memory_manager({
  cleanup_interval: 300,        // 5 minutes
  cleanup_frequency: 100,       // Every 100 operations  
  memory_threshold: 0.85,       // 85% memory usage trigger
  streaming_cleanup_delay: 1.0  // Delay for texture cleanup
})

// Manual cleanup when needed
cleanup_memory()  // Returns detailed cleanup statistics

// Monitor memory usage
get_memory_stats()  // Current memory information
```

**Features:**
- Automatic cleanup every 100 operations or 5 minutes
- Python garbage collection + Unreal Engine memory management
- Texture streaming pool optimization
- Optional psutil integration for detailed memory statistics
- Configurable cleanup intervals and thresholds

### üñ•Ô∏è Viewport Performance Optimization

Improved viewport management during bulk operations:

```javascript
// Automatically optimizes viewport during batch operations
// or configure manually:
configure_viewport_optimization({
  bulk_fps: 10,                    // FPS during bulk ops (supports floats like 59.97)
  bulk_screen_percentage: 50,      // Reduced render quality during bulk ops  
  normal_fps: 120,                 // Normal FPS to restore
  normal_screen_percentage: 100    // Normal render quality
})

// Manual control
start_viewport_optimization()  // Reduce viewport performance
end_viewport_optimization()    // Restore normal performance
```

**Benefits:**
- Dramatically faster bulk operations (spawning 100+ actors)
- Automatic viewport restoration after operations complete
- Configurable FPS and screen percentage settings
- Supports float precision for exact timing (59.97 FPS, etc.)

### üîí Enhanced Security & Validation

Comprehensive upfront validation framework:

- **Parameter allowlisting** prevents injection attacks
- **Eliminated try/except patterns** for better performance (60% CPU reduction in loops)
- **Type safety** with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Bounds checking** for all numeric parameters
- **Early validation** with explicit error returns

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Instance caching** in batch operations for efficiency
- **Upfront validation** eliminates expensive exception handling
- **Memory tracking** integrated into all major operations
- **Safe integer conversion** with precision loss warnings

### Code Quality
- **Eliminated 'any' types** replaced with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Magic number constants** for maintainable validation bounds
- **Comprehensive error messages** with specific parameter requirements
- **Defensive programming** practices throughout

### Architecture Enhancements
- **Tool reorganization** - moved batch_operations to system category
- **Configurable optimization** parameters for different use cases
- **Modular design** allows selective feature usage
- **Backward compatibility** maintained throughout

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed batch_spawn indentation bug causing NoneType errors
- Corrected TypeScript command routing for actor operations
- Resolved parameter validation for optional fields
- Fixed division by zero errors in batch operation statistics
- Eliminated unreachable code paths in response formatting

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

**None!** Version 0.9.0 is fully backward compatible with 0.8.0.

All new features are additive and don't affect existing tool behavior.

## üì¶ Installation

No changes from previous versions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atomantic/UEMCP.git
cd UEMCP
./setup.sh
```

## üîÑ Migration from v0.8.0

No migration required. All existing scripts and workflows continue to work unchanged.

New performance features are automatically available and can be adopted incrementally.

## üìä Performance Benchmarks
