# UEMCP v0.2.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** July 28, 2024  
**Theme:** Critical Rotation Bug Fix

## üêõ Critical Bug Fix

### Fixed Rotation Format Inconsistency

This release fixes a critical bug where rotation formats were inconsistent across the system, causing incorrect actor placement and viewport camera issues.

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Standardized Rotation Format

**Before:** Mixed rotation formats causing confusion and errors  
**After:** Consistent [Roll, Pitch, Yaw] format throughout

- Fixed Python listener (`uemcp_listener.py`) to use correct Unreal Engine rotation order
- Updated all MCP tool descriptions to match:
  - `actor_modify`
  - `actor_spawn`
  - `viewport_camera`
- Fixed `actor.modify` return value to use consistent format
- Updated all documentation with correct rotation examples

## üìê Rotation Standard

The system now consistently uses:
```
[Roll, Pitch, Yaw] = [X-axis, Y-axis, Z-axis]
```

### Common Rotation Patterns

**Walls:**
```javascript
// Wall facing north
rotation: [0, 0, 0]

// Wall rotated 90¬∞ clockwise
rotation: [0, 0, 90]
```

**Viewport Camera:**
```javascript
// Top-down view (looking straight down)
rotation: [0, -90, 0]  // Only modify Pitch

// Avoid Roll to prevent tilted horizon
// ‚ùå Wrong: [90, 0, 0] - This tilts the view
// ‚úÖ Right: [0, -90, 0] - This looks down
```

## üìö Documentation Updates

- Added comprehensive rotation documentation in PLAN.md
- Updated rotation examples for walls, corners, and viewport camera
- Added troubleshooting section for rotation issues
- Updated CLAUDE.md with viewport best practices

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

None. This fix ensures the system works as originally intended.

## üîÑ Migration

No migration needed. Existing code using the correct format will continue to work.
