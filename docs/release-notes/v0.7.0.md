# UEMCP v0.7.0 Release Notes

## üéØ Theme: Socket-Based Building & Enhanced Workflows

Released: December 28, 2024

## üöÄ Major Features

### 1. Socket-Based Placement System
The new `actor_snap_to_socket` tool revolutionizes modular building workflows:
- **Automatic Alignment**: Snap actors precisely to socket points without manual coordinate calculations
- **Smart Socket Discovery**: Returns available sockets when target not found
- **Flexible Connections**: Support for source-to-target socket alignment
- **Offset Support**: Apply positional offsets from socket points for fine-tuning
- **Built-in Validation**: Confirm successful placement automatically
- **85% Code Reduction**: Compared to manual python_proxy calculations

**Example:**
```javascript
// Snap a door to a wall's door socket - it just works!
actor_snap_to_socket({ 
  sourceActor: "Door_01", 
  targetActor: "Wall_01", 
  targetSocket: "DoorSocket" 
})
```

### 2. Enhanced Building Workflows

#### Batch Spawn (4-5x Performance Improvement)
- Spawn multiple actors in a single operation
- Automatic viewport batching for better performance
- Common folder organization support
- Batch validation of all spawned actors

#### Placement Validation
- Detect gaps between modular components
- Identify overlapping geometry with severity levels
- Check modular grid alignment
- Provide actionable correction suggestions

#### Asset Import from FAB Marketplace
- Import assets directly from FAB or local files
- Support for FBX, OBJ, DAE, and texture formats
- Advanced import settings (collision, LODs, materials)
- Batch import with recursive folder support

### 3. Comprehensive Asset Information
The enhanced `asset_info` tool now provides everything needed for intelligent placement:
- **Bounds**: Min/max bounds for precise calculations
- **Pivot Detection**: Automatic pivot type detection (center, bottom-center, corner)
- **Socket Data**: Complete socket information for snapping
- **Collision Info**: Primitive shapes and complexity data
- **Materials**: Full material slot information
- **Components**: Blueprint component details

## üìä By The Numbers
- **30 MCP Tools** (up from 22 in v0.6.0)
- **85% Code Reduction** with socket snapping vs manual calculations
- **4-5x Performance** improvement with batch operations
- **100% Test Coverage** for new features
- **2-3 Second** hot reload time with `restart_listener()`

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes
- **restart_listener Stability**: Fixed deadlock issues that could freeze Unreal Engine
- **Material Retrieval**: Fixed deprecated API usage for UE 5.6 compatibility
- **Thread Management**: Proper cleanup prevents orphaned threads
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing assets and invalid operations

### Improvements
- Better error messages throughout the system
- More informative validation results
- Cleaner module reloading for hot reload
- Reduced audio buffer underrun warnings

## üîß Developer Experience

### Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive integration tests for socket snapping
- Python unit tests for transformation mathematics
- Manual test scripts for quick validation
- Updated test documentation with examples

### Documentation
- New socket snapping examples and workflows
- Complete API documentation for new tools
- Updated troubleshooting guide
- Release planning documentation

## üéÆ Getting Started

### Quick Socket Snapping Example
```python
# Spawn modular walls
actor_spawn({ assetPath: "/Game/ModularOldTown/Wall", name: "Wall_North" })
actor_spawn({ assetPath: "/Game/ModularOldTown/Wall_Door", name: "Wall_South", location: [0, 600, 0] })

# Spawn a door somewhere
actor_spawn({ assetPath: "/Game/ModularOldTown/Door", name: "Door_01", location: [1000, 1000, 0] })

# Snap door to wall socket - automatically aligns position AND rotation!
actor_snap_to_socket({ 
  sourceActor: "Door_01", 
  targetActor: "Wall_South", 
  targetSocket: "DoorSocket" 
})
```

### Batch Operations Example
```python
# Spawn 10 walls efficiently
batch_spawn({ 
  actors: [
    { assetPath: "/Game/Wall", location: [0, 0, 0], name: "Wall_1" },
    { assetPath: "/Game/Wall", location: [300, 0, 0], name: "Wall_2" },
    // ... more actors
  ],
  commonFolder: "Building/FirstFloor",
  validate: true
})
```

## üí° What's Next

### Coming in v0.8.0 (February 2025)
- Blueprint manipulation tools
- Undo/Redo system
- Socket pattern matching
- Enhanced error recovery

### Roadmap to v1.0.0 (April 2025)
- Production-ready performance
- Complete Blueprint editing
- Advanced caching system
- 90%+ test coverage

## üôè Acknowledgments
