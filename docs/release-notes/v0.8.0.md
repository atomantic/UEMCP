# UEMCP v0.8.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** January 2025  
**Theme:** Blueprint Integration & Advanced Workflows

## üéâ Overview

Version 0.8.0 introduces Blueprint creation capabilities and a comprehensive undo/redo system, marking a significant milestone in programmatic Unreal Engine control through MCP.

## ‚ú® Major Features

### üèóÔ∏è Blueprint Creation Tool

The new `blueprint_create` tool enables programmatic Blueprint class creation:

```javascript
// Create a new Blueprint from Actor parent
blueprint_create({
  className: "BP_Door",
  parentClass: "Actor",
  targetFolder: "/Game/Blueprints"
})

// Create from another Blueprint parent
blueprint_create({
  className: "BP_InteractiveDoor",
  parentClass: "/Game/Blueprints/BP_BaseDoor"
})
```

**Features:**
- Create new Blueprint classes from C++ or Blueprint parents
- Automatic parent class resolution and validation
- Organized output to project folders
- Support for component and variable definitions (limited by UE Python API)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot add components or variables programmatically due to UE Python API restrictions
- These must be added manually in the Blueprint editor after creation

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è Comprehensive Undo/Redo System

Full operation history tracking with intelligent undo/redo support:

```javascript
// Perform operations
actor_spawn({ assetPath: "/Game/Cube", name: "TestCube" })
actor_modify({ actorName: "TestCube", location: [100, 200, 0] })

// Undo last operation
undo()  // Moves TestCube back to original position

// Redo operation
redo()  // Moves TestCube to [100, 200, 0] again

// View history
history()  // Shows all operations with timestamps
```

**Features:**
- Smart undo data capture for all actor operations
- Operation descriptions and timestamps
- Memory-managed history (100 operation limit)
- Automatic cleanup of old operations

### üìå Checkpoint System

Create named checkpoints for complex multi-step operations:

```javascript
// Create checkpoint before major changes
checkpoint_create({ 
  name: "before_building", 
  description: "State before house construction" 
})

// Perform many operations...

// Restore if needed
checkpoint_restore({ name: "before_building" })

// List all checkpoints
checkpoint_list()
```

**Features:**
- Named checkpoints with descriptions
- Restore to any checkpoint with automatic undo/redo
- Checkpoint persistence across operations
- Useful for batch operations and experimentation

### üì∑ Enhanced Viewport Controls

Improved `viewport_look_at` tool with configurable camera angles:

```javascript
// Look at location with custom pitch angle
viewport_look_at({
  target: [1000, 500, 0],
  pitch: -45,     // Camera angle (default: -30)
  distance: 1500, // Distance from target
  height: 800     // Height offset
})

// Look at specific actor
viewport_look_at({
  actorName: "HouseFoundation",
  pitch: -60  // Steeper angle for top-down view
})
```

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript type safety throughout codebase
- Proper error response types with `ResponseFormatter.error()`
- Eliminated unsafe type assertions

### Performance
- Optimized tool instantiation and validation
- Reduced overhead in operation tracking
- Efficient memory management for history

### Code Quality
- Using `crypto.randomUUID()` for collision-resistant IDs
- Centralized tool mapping system for operations
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed hardcoded angle in `viewport_look_at` tool
- Corrected Yaw calculation for accurate camera positioning
- Fixed error response formatting throughout codebase
- Resolved tool instantiation performance issues
- Fixed Python import error in `blueprint.py` (utils.logger ‚Üí utils.general)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Blueprint System
- Cannot add components or variables programmatically (UE Python API limitation)
- Blueprint modification requires manual editing in UE editor
- No support for Blueprint event graphs via Python

### Undo/Redo System
- Actor metadata stored in tags (temporary solution until UE 5.5+)
- Some complex operations may not fully undo
- Redo requires explicit tool mapping entries

## üì¶ Installation

No breaking changes from v0.7.0. Follow standard installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atomantic/UEMCP.git
cd UEMCP
./setup.sh
```

## üîÑ Migration from v0.7.0

No migration required. v0.8.0 is fully backward compatible.

New features are additive and don't affect existing tools.

## üìö Documentation Updates

- Updated CLAUDE.md with viewport best practices
- Added comprehensive Blueprint creation examples
- Documented undo/redo system architecture
- Added checkpoint system usage guide
- Updated troubleshooting guide for safe restart mechanism

## üöÄ What's Next

### v0.9.0 (Production Readiness)
- Performance optimizations for large scenes (1000+ actors)
- Advanced caching system
- Comprehensive validation suite
- 80%+ test coverage

### v1.0.0 (Production Release)
- Full production stability
- Complete documentation
- Video tutorials
- Community support channels
