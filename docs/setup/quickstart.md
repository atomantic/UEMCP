# UEMCP Quick Start Guide

Welcome to UEMCP! This guide will get you up and running in under 5 minutes.

## ðŸš€ One-Command Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atomantic/UEMCP.git
cd UEMCP
./setup.sh
```

That's it! The setup script handles everything automatically, including installing Node.js and Python if needed.

### Advanced Setup Options

```bash
# Install to your Unreal project (automatically installs plugin)
./setup.sh --project "/path/to/your/ue/project"

# Non-interactive mode (great for CI/CD)
./setup.sh --no-interactive --project "/path/to/project"

# See all options
./setup.sh --help
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What Just Happened?

The setup script:
1. âœ… Detected your installed AI development tools
2. âœ… Configured MCP support for Claude, Amazon Q, Gemini, and Codex
3. âœ… Installed Node.js if not present
4. âœ… Installed Python if not present (optional)
5. âœ… Created a virtual environment for Python
6. âœ… Installed all dependencies
7. âœ… Built the MCP server
8. âœ… Asked for your Unreal Engine project path (optional)
9. âœ… Installed the UEMCP plugin to your project (if requested)

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Local Connection Test
```bash
node test-connection.js
```

You should see:
- Server starting up
- List of available tools
- Successful connection message

### Test 2: Claude Desktop
1. **Restart Claude Desktop** (important!)
2. Start a new conversation
3. Say: "What UEMCP tools are available?"

Claude should respond with a list of available Unreal Engine tools.

## ðŸŽ® Using UEMCP

### Basic Commands

Ask Claude to:
- "Show me information about my current UE project"
- "List the assets in my project"
- "Spawn a cube at location 0,0,100"
- "Take a screenshot of the viewport"
- "Show me all actors in the current level"
- "Save the current level"

### Setting Your Project

If you didn't set a project during init:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
export UE_PROJECT_PATH="/path/to/your/project.uproject"

# Windows
set UE_PROJECT_PATH=C:\path\to\your\project.uproject
```

**Note:** The path should point to the `.uproject` file, not just the directory.

### Installing the Plugin

For full functionality, install the UEMCP plugin to your UE project:

```bash
# If you didn't do this during setup, run:
./setup.sh --project "/path/to/project.uproject"
```

The plugin enables:
- Python listener for real-time commands
- All 11 MCP tools
- Hot reload support

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues

### "Claude doesn't see UEMCP"
- Make sure you **fully restarted** Claude Desktop
- Check the MCP indicator in Claude's interface
- Run `node test-connection.js` to verify the server works

### "Project not found"
- Set your project path: `export UE_PROJECT_PATH="/actual/path"`
- Make sure the path points to your `.uproject` file's directory

### "Permission denied"
- On macOS/Linux: `chmod +x setup.sh`
- On Windows: Run using Git Bash or WSL

## ðŸ“š Next Steps

1. **Explore available tools**: Ask Claude "What can you do with Unreal Engine?"
2. **Read the docs**: Check out [complete documentation](../README.md)
3. **Join the community**: Report issues or request features on GitHub

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- Enable debug logging: `export DEBUG=uemcp:*`
- Watch server logs: `tail -f ~/.uemcp/logs/server.log` (if logging is enabled)
- Use environment files: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for persistent config
