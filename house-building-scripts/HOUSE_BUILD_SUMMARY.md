# House Build Summary

## What We Accomplished

1. **Created a Mathematical Building Plan**
   - Designed a 10m x 8m house with precise coordinates
   - Created a TSV file with exact placement data
   - Successfully placed most components

2. **Key Issues Discovered**

### Actor Naming Problem
- Actors are spawned with generic names like "UEMCP_Actor_1753576458"
- Our custom names (e.g., "Corner_GF_Front_Left") are not being applied
- This makes it difficult to verify and modify specific pieces

### Asset Path Issues
- Some assets couldn't be found:
  - `SM_FlatWall_2m_Window_Square` - doesn't exist
  - `SM_FlatWall_3m_Door_Square` - should be `SM_FlatWall_3m_SquareDoor`
  - Need to verify exact asset names before using

### Camera Control Lessons
- **CRITICAL**: Camera rotation uses [Pitch, Yaw, Roll]
  - Pitch: -90 for top-down view
  - Roll: Keep at 0 to avoid tilted horizon
- My error: Used Rotator(0, 0, -90) which rotated the horizon 90Â°
- Correct: Use Rotator(-90, 0, 0) for proper top-down view

## What Was Built

From the screenshots, we successfully placed:
- Ground floor structure with corners and walls
- Second floor corners and some walls
- Partial second floor tiles (10 of 80 needed)
- All aligned properly on the foundation

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Actor Naming**
   - The actor_spawn tool needs to properly apply custom names
   - Or use a different approach to track spawned actors

2. **Complete Missing Elements**
   - Find correct door asset name
   - Use solid walls instead of window variants if needed
   - Complete second floor tiles

3. **Add Roof Structure**
   - Use roof pieces from the modular set

## Improved Workflow

The TSV-based mathematical approach worked well for:
- Precise placement calculations
- Batch spawning of components
- Maintaining alignment and spacing

This method is much more reliable than manual placement!
