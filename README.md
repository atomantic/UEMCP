## üöÄ Quick Start (2 minutes)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/atomantic/UEMCP.git
cd UEMCP
./setup.sh

# Restart Claude Desktop or Claude Code and test:
# "List available UEMCP tools"
# "Organize the actors in the current map into a sensible folder structure and naming convention"
```

The setup script automatically:
- ‚úÖ Checks and installs Node.js if needed (via Homebrew, apt, yum, or nvm)
- ‚úÖ Installs dependencies and builds the server
- ‚úÖ **Detects and configures AI development tools** (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Amazon Q, Gemini Code Assist, OpenAI Codex)
- ‚úÖ Sets up your Unreal Engine project path
- ‚úÖ Optionally installs the UEMCP plugin to your project

The script will detect which AI tools you have installed and offer to configure them:
- **Claude Desktop & Claude Code**: Native MCP support
- **Amazon Q**: MCP support via `~/.aws/amazonq/agents/default.json`
- **Google Gemini (CLI & Code Assist)**: MCP support via `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- **OpenAI Codex**: Trusted projects via `~/.codex/config.toml`
- **GitHub Copilot**: Usage instructions provided

### üìù Windows Users

**Recommended: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**
```bash
# Install WSL if you haven't already
wsl --install

# In WSL/Ubuntu terminal:
git clone https://github.com/atomantic/UEMCP.git
cd UEMCP
./setup.sh
```

**Alternative: Git Bash**
- Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) which includes Git Bash
- Run `./setup.sh` in Git Bash terminal

**Note:** The setup script will copy (not symlink) the plugin to your UE project on Windows to avoid permission issues.

**Advanced options:**
```bash
# Specify UE project (automatically installs plugin via copy)
./setup.sh --project "/path/to/project.uproject"

# Install with symlink for UEMCP plugin development
./setup.sh --project "/path/to/project.uproject" --symlink

# Non-interactive mode (for CI/CD)
./setup.sh --project "/path/to/project.uproject" --no-interactive
```

## Prompt Examples

The sky is the limit with what you can ask the agent to do. Here are example prompts organized by complexity:

### Basic Commands
- Show me all wall meshes in the ModularOldTown folder
- Spawn a cube at location 1000, 500, 0
- Take a screenshot of the current viewport
- List all actors with 'Door' in their name
- Focus the camera on the player start
- Check the UE logs for any errors

### Complex Tasks
- Add the Rive Unreal plugin to this project: https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal
- Use the OldModularTown assets in this project to build the first floor of a house
- Find all the maze walls and invert them on the X axis to flip the maze over
- Add a textured and colored material to the HorseArena floor

### Advanced Python Control
- Use python_proxy to get all actors of type StaticMeshActor
- Execute Python to change all lights to blue
- Run Python code to analyze material usage in the level
- Batch rename all actors to follow a consistent naming convention
- Create a custom layout algorithm for procedural level generation


## üéØ Key Feature: Full Python Access in Editor Mode

**The `python_proxy` tool provides complete, unrestricted access to Unreal Engine's Python API.** This means AI assistants can execute ANY Python code within the UE editor - from simple queries to complex automation scripts. All other MCP tools are essentially convenience wrappers around common operations that could be done through `python_proxy`.

### Why have other tools if python_proxy can do everything?

1. **Efficiency**: Specific tools like `actor_spawn` or `viewport_screenshot` are optimized shortcuts for common tasks that remove the need for your AI to write larger amounts of python code.
2. **Clarity**: Named tools make AI intent clearer (e.g., "spawn an actor" vs "execute Python code")
3. **Error Handling**: Dedicated tools provide better validation and error messages
4. **Performance**: Less overhead than parsing and executing arbitrary Python for simple operations
5. **Discoverability**: AI assistants can easily see available operations without knowing the UE Python API

### Example: Taking a Screenshot

**Using the convenient `viewport_screenshot` mcp tool:**
```javascript
// One line, clear intent, automatic file handling
viewport_screenshot({ width: 1920, height: 1080, quality: 80 })
```

**Using `python_proxy` for the same task:**
```python
# Much more complex, requires knowing UE Python API
import unreal
import os
import time

# Get project paths
project_path = unreal.Paths.project_saved_dir()
screenshot_dir = os.path.join(project_path, "Screenshots", "MacEditor")

# Ensure directory exists
if not os.path.exists(screenshot_dir):
    os.makedirs(screenshot_dir)

# Generate filename with timestamp
timestamp = int(time.time() * 1000)
filename = f"uemcp_screenshot_{timestamp}.png"
filepath = os.path.join(screenshot_dir, filename)

# Take screenshot with proper settings
unreal.AutomationLibrary.take_high_res_screenshot(
    1920, 1080,
    filepath,
    camera=None,
    capture_hdr=False,
    comparison_tolerance=unreal.ComparisonTolerance.LOW
)

# Would need additional error handling, JPEG conversion for quality, etc.
result = f"Screenshot saved to: {filepath}"
```

Think of it like this: `python_proxy` is the powerful command line, while other tools are the convenient GUI buttons.

üìä **[See detailed comparison of MCP tools vs python_proxy ‚Üí](docs/reference/mcp-tools-vs-python-proxy.md)** (average 80%+ code reduction!)

- **material_apply** - Apply materials to actors' static mesh components

### üîç Validation Feature

All actor manipulation tools (`actor_spawn`, `actor_modify`, `actor_delete`, `actor_duplicate`) now support automatic validation to ensure operations succeeded as expected:

- **validate** parameter (default: `true`) - Verifies changes were applied correctly in Unreal Engine
- Checks location, rotation, scale, mesh, and folder values match requested values
- Returns validation results including any errors or warnings
- Set `validate: false` for "reckless mode" to skip validation for performance

Example with validation:
```javascript
// Spawn with automatic validation
actor_spawn({ 
  assetPath: "/Game/Meshes/Wall", 
  location: [1000, 0, 0],
  rotation: [0, 0, 90]
})
// Response includes: validated: true/false, validation_errors: [...]

// Modify without validation for faster execution
actor_modify({ 
  actorName: "Wall_01", 
  location: [2000, 0, 0],
  validate: false  // Skip validation check
})
```

### üöÄ Batch Operations

The `batch_operations` tool allows you to execute multiple operations in a single HTTP request, reducing overhead by 80-90% for bulk operations:

```javascript
// Execute multiple operations efficiently
batch_operations({
  operations: [
    {
      operation: "actor_spawn",
      params: { assetPath: "/Game/Meshes/Wall", location: [0, 0, 0] },
      id: "wall_1"
    },
    {
      operation: "actor_spawn", 
      params: { assetPath: "/Game/Meshes/Wall", location: [300, 0, 0] },
      id: "wall_2"
    },
    {
      operation: "viewport_camera",
      params: { location: [150, -500, 300], rotation: [0, -30, 0] },
      id: "camera_pos"
    },
    {
      operation: "viewport_screenshot",
      params: { width: 800, height: 600 },
      id: "screenshot"
    }
  ]
})
// Returns: success/failure status for each operation with timing info
```

**Benefits:**
- **80-90% faster** than individual tool calls for bulk operations
- **Atomic execution** - all operations processed in one request
- **Detailed results** - individual success/failure status for each operation
- **Performance tracking** - execution time and memory management

### Advanced
- **batch_operations** üöÄ - Execute multiple operations in a single HTTP request to reduce overhead by 80-90%. Supports `actor_spawn`, `actor_modify`, `actor_delete`, `actor_duplicate`, `viewport_camera`, and `viewport_screenshot`
- **python_proxy** ‚≠ê - Execute ANY Python code with full [UE API access](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/python-api/?application_version=5.6). This is the most powerful tool - it can do everything the other tools can do and more!
- **test_connection** - Test connection to UE Python listener
- **restart_listener** - Stop listener for hot reload (requires manual restart - see Development section)
- **ue_logs** - Read recent lines from UE console log file (useful for debugging)

### Help & Documentation
- **help** üìö - Get inline help and examples for all UEMCP tools. This is your **starting point** for learning UEMCP!
  - `help({})` - Overview with categories and common workflows
  - `help({ tool: "actor_spawn" })` - Detailed examples for specific tools
  - `help({ category: "viewport" })` - List all tools in a category


### Example: Using python_proxy for Complex Operations

```python
# With python_proxy, you can do anything you could do in UE's Python console:
import unreal

# Batch operations
actors = unreal.EditorLevelLibrary.get_all_level_actors()
for actor in actors:
    if "Old" in actor.get_actor_label():
        actor.destroy_actor()

# Complex asset queries
materials = unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.list_assets("/Game/Materials", recursive=True)
for mat_path in materials:
    material = unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.load_asset(mat_path)
    # Analyze or modify material properties...

# Editor automation
def auto_layout_actors(spacing=500):
    selected = unreal.EditorLevelLibrary.get_selected_level_actors()
    for i, actor in enumerate(selected):
        actor.set_actor_location(unreal.Vector(i * spacing, 0, 0))
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Unreal Engine 5.1+ (5.4+ recommended)
- Python 3.11 (matches UE's built-in version)
- An MCP-compatible AI client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor)

## üí° Usage Examples

### Getting Started with Help

**The `help` tool is self-documenting!** Start here:

```javascript
// First command to run - shows all tools and workflows
help({})

// Learn about specific tools
help({ tool: "actor_spawn" })
help({ tool: "python_proxy" })

// Explore by category
help({ category: "level" })     // All level editing tools
help({ category: "viewport" })  // Camera and rendering tools
```

### Important: Workflow with Claude Code

When using UEMCP with Claude Code, the proper workflow is:

1. **Start Unreal Engine first** with your project open
2. **Then launch Claude Code** - it will automatically start the MCP server and connect
3. **If you restart Unreal Engine**, the MCP server will automatically reconnect
   - The server runs health checks every 5 seconds for quick reconnection
   - It will detect when UE goes offline and comes back online within seconds
   - You'll see connection status in the Claude Code logs

**Note**: The MCP server is (theoretically) resilient to UE restarts - you don't need to restart Claude Code when restarting Unreal Engine. The connection will automatically restore once UE is running again.

## üèó Architecture

```
UEMCP bridges AI ‚Üî Unreal Engine:
Claude Desktop ‚Üí MCP Server (Node.js) ‚Üí Python Listener ‚Üí Unreal Engine

Key Features:
- Content-only plugin (no C++ compilation needed)
- Hot reload support for rapid development
- Full access to UE Python API
- Background HTTP listener (non-blocking)
- Modular Python architecture for maintainability
```

### Modular Python Architecture

The Python plugin uses a clean, modular architecture (refactored from a monolithic 2090-line file):

- **Operation Modules**: Focused modules for actors, viewport, assets, level, and system operations
- **Command Registry**: Automatic command discovery and dispatch
- **Validation Framework**: Optional post-operation validation with tolerance-based comparisons
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized across all operations
- **85% Code Reduction**: When using dedicated MCP tools vs python_proxy

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

### Plugin Development

**Recommended: Use symlinks for hot reloading**

The init script now supports creating symlinks automatically:
```bash
# Install with symlink (recommended for development)
node init.js --project "/path/to/project.uproject" --symlink

# Or let it ask you interactively (defaults to symlink)
node init.js --project "/path/to/project.uproject"
```

Benefits of symlinking:
- ‚úÖ Edit plugin files directly in the git repository
- ‚úÖ Changes reflect immediately after `restart_listener()`
- ‚úÖ No need to copy files back and forth
- ‚úÖ Version control friendly

```bash
# Available helpers in UE Python console:
status()            # Check if running
stop_listener()     # Stop listener
start_listener()    # Start listener
```

### Hot Reloading Code Changes

you can reload the unreal plugin and restart the python server from the mcp or from the unreal engine python command prompt:

```python
restart_listener()
```

### Adding New Tools
1. Add command handler in `plugin/Content/Python/uemcp_listener.py`
2. Create MCP tool wrapper in `server/src/tools/`
3. Register tool in `server/src/index.ts`

### Testing
```bash
# Run full test suite (mimics CI)
./test-ci-locally.sh

# Individual tests
npm test              # JavaScript tests
python -m pytest      # Python tests
npm run lint          # Linting
```

### Diagnostic Testing

Validate your MCP setup with the diagnostic test scripts:

```bash
# Quick diagnostic checklist
node scripts/mcp-diagnostic.js

# Interactive test suite (requires user verification)
node scripts/diagnostic-test.js
```

The diagnostic tests validate all MCP functionality including:
- Connection and project info
- Asset management (list, info)  
- Level operations (spawn, modify, delete actors)
- Viewport control (camera, screenshots, render modes)
- Material system (list, create, apply)
- Advanced features (python_proxy, batch operations)

**Expected success rate: 100%** for a properly configured system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

While UEMCP provides comprehensive UE control, there are some current limitations:

### ‚úÖ MCP Tool Capabilities

UEMCP provides comprehensive automation with **39 production-ready MCP tools**:

- ‚úÖ **Asset Snapping**: `actor_snap_to_socket` provides precise modular placement with automated socket-based positioning
- ‚úÖ **Undo/Redo System**: Full operation history with `undo`, `redo`, `history_list`, `checkpoint_create`, and `checkpoint_restore`
- ‚úÖ **Blueprint Creation**: `blueprint_create` generates Blueprint classes with components and variables
- ‚úÖ **Material Management**: Complete material workflow via `material_create`, `material_apply`, `material_info`, `material_list`
- ‚úÖ **Placement Validation**: Gap/overlap detection via `placement_validate` tool
- ‚úÖ **Asset Information**: Complete bounds, pivot, socket, and collision data via enhanced `asset_info`
- ‚úÖ **Batch Operations**: Execute multiple operations with 80-90% performance improvement
- ‚úÖ **Viewport Control**: Complete camera, rendering, and screenshot management

### Current MCP Tool Limitations
- **Blueprint Graph Editing**: Cannot programmatically edit Blueprint node graphs (visual scripting logic)
- **Animation Blueprints**: No direct animation state machine or blend tree manipulation
- **Level Streaming**: No dynamic level loading/unloading control

### Python API Issues
- **Actor References**: `get_actor_reference()` doesn't work with display names (workaround implemented)
- **Viewport Methods**: Several deprecated (see [Python API Workarounds](docs/python-api-workarounds.md))

### Workarounds Available
Most remaining limitations can be worked around using the `python_proxy` tool. See our documentation:
- [Python API Workarounds](docs/python-api-workarounds.md) - Common fixes
- [House Building Experiment](docs/house-building-experiment.md) - Real-world solutions
