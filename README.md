UEMCP bridges AI assistants with Unreal Engine, enabling intelligent control of game development workflows through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## üéØ Key Feature: Full Python Access in Editor Mode

**The `python_proxy` tool provides complete, unrestricted access to Unreal Engine's Python API.** This means AI assistants can execute ANY Python code within the UE editor - from simple queries to complex automation scripts. All other MCP tools are essentially convenience wrappers around common operations that could be done through `python_proxy`.

### Why have other tools if python_proxy can do everything?

1. **Efficiency**: Specific tools like `actor_spawn` or `viewport_screenshot` are optimized shortcuts for common tasks that remove the need for your AI to write larger amounts of python code.
2. **Clarity**: Named tools make AI intent clearer (e.g., "spawn an actor" vs "execute Python code")
3. **Error Handling**: Dedicated tools provide better validation and error messages
4. **Performance**: Less overhead than parsing and executing arbitrary Python for simple operations
5. **Discoverability**: AI assistants can easily see available operations without knowing the UE Python API

### Example: Taking a Screenshot

**Using the convenient `viewport_screenshot` mcp tool:**
```javascript
// One line, clear intent, automatic file handling
viewport_screenshot({ width: 1920, height: 1080, quality: 80 })
```

**Using `python_proxy` for the same task:**
```python
# Much more complex, requires knowing UE Python API
import unreal
import os
import time

# Get project paths
project_path = unreal.Paths.project_saved_dir()
screenshot_dir = os.path.join(project_path, "Screenshots", "MacEditor")

# Ensure directory exists
if not os.path.exists(screenshot_dir):
    os.makedirs(screenshot_dir)

# Generate filename with timestamp
timestamp = int(time.time() * 1000)
filename = f"uemcp_screenshot_{timestamp}.png"
filepath = os.path.join(screenshot_dir, filename)

# Take screenshot with proper settings
unreal.AutomationLibrary.take_high_res_screenshot(
    1920, 1080,
    filepath,
    camera=None,
    capture_hdr=False,
    comparison_tolerance=unreal.ComparisonTolerance.LOW
)

# Would need additional error handling, JPEG conversion for quality, etc.
result = f"Screenshot saved to: {filepath}"
```

Think of it like this: `python_proxy` is the powerful command line, while other tools are the convenient GUI buttons.

üìä **[See detailed comparison of MCP tools vs python_proxy ‚Üí](docs/mcp-tools-vs-python-proxy.md)** (average 80%+ code reduction!)

> Note: This project was made because I wanted to have my own UE MCP since Epic does not have plans to create one (or at least has not alluded to one being on the roadmap)--and I wanted this to do some things that other WIP UE MCP projects didn't support. This is working for me on my macbook with UE 5.6. As I test it with other environments and unreal versions (I do have plans to do so), I will update it. If you happen to want to use it and find it doesn't work in another environment or version of unreal, please open a pull-request. This project is entirely coded with Claude Code so feel free to use the CLAUDE.md and other files in here that can aid in development and testing. Or file issues, and I (or claude, or codex) will take a look.

## üöÄ Quick Start (2 minutes)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/atomantic/UEMCP.git
cd UEMCP
node init.js

# Restart Claude Desktop and test:
# "List available UEMCP tools"
# "Show me the assets in my Unreal project"
```

The init script automatically:
- ‚úÖ Installs dependencies and builds the server
- ‚úÖ Configures Claude Desktop (or Claude Code with `--claude-code` flag)
- ‚úÖ Sets up your Unreal Engine project path
- ‚úÖ Optionally installs the UEMCP plugin to your project

**Advanced options:**
```bash
# Configure for Claude Code (claude.ai/code)
node init.js --claude-code

# Specify UE project (automatically installs plugin to specified unreal engine project)
node init.js --project "/path/to/project.uproject"

# Install with symlink for plugin development
node init.js --project "/path/to/project.uproject" --symlink

# Non-interactive with all options
node init.js --claude-code --project "/path/to/project.uproject" --no-interactive
```

## üõ† Available Tools

UEMCP provides 19 tools to Claude for controlling Unreal Engine:

### Project & Assets
- **project_info** - Get current project information
- **asset_list** - List and filter project assets
- **asset_info** - Get detailed asset information (dimensions, materials, etc.)

### Level Editing
- **actor_spawn** - Spawn actors from any mesh or blueprint
- **actor_duplicate** - Duplicate existing actors with optional offset
- **actor_delete** - Delete actors by name
- **actor_modify** - Change actor transform and organization
- **actor_organize** - Organize actors into World Outliner folders
- **level_actors** - List all actors in the current level
- **level_save** - Save the current level
- **level_outliner** - View World Outliner folder structure

### Viewport Control
- **viewport_screenshot** - Capture viewport screenshots
- **viewport_camera** - Control camera position and orientation
- **viewport_mode** - Switch between perspective/orthographic views
- **viewport_focus** - Focus on specific actors
- **viewport_render_mode** - Change rendering mode (wireframe, unlit, etc.)

### Advanced
- **python_proxy** ‚≠ê - Execute ANY Python code with full [UE API access](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/python-api/?application_version=5.6). This is the most powerful tool - it can do everything the other tools can do and more!
- **test_connection** - Test connection to UE Python listener
- **restart_listener** - Hot reload Python code changes
- **ue_logs** - Read recent lines from UE console log file (useful for debugging)

### Example: Using python_proxy for Complex Operations

```python
# With python_proxy, you can do anything you could do in UE's Python console:
import unreal

# Batch operations
actors = unreal.EditorLevelLibrary.get_all_level_actors()
for actor in actors:
    if "Old" in actor.get_actor_label():
        actor.destroy_actor()

# Complex asset queries
materials = unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.list_assets("/Game/Materials", recursive=True)
for mat_path in materials:
    material = unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.load_asset(mat_path)
    # Analyze or modify material properties...

# Editor automation
def auto_layout_actors(spacing=500):
    selected = unreal.EditorLevelLibrary.get_selected_level_actors()
    for i, actor in enumerate(selected):
        actor.set_actor_location(unreal.Vector(i * spacing, 0, 0))
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Unreal Engine 5.1+ (5.4+ recommended)
- Python 3.11 (matches UE's built-in version)
- An MCP-compatible AI client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor)

## üîß Installation Options

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
node init.js
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd server && npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build server
npm run build

# Configure Claude Desktop
# Copy claude-desktop-config.example.json to:
# macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
# Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
# Update paths in the config

# Set environment
export UE_PROJECT_PATH="/path/to/your/project"
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Important: Workflow with Claude Code

When using UEMCP with Claude Code (`claude -c`), the proper workflow is:

1. **Start Unreal Engine first** with your project open
2. **Then launch Claude Code** - it will automatically start the MCP server and connect
3. **If you restart Unreal Engine**, the MCP server will automatically reconnect
   - The server runs health checks every 5 seconds for quick reconnection
   - It will detect when UE goes offline and comes back online within seconds
   - You'll see connection status in the Claude Code logs

**Note**: The MCP server is resilient to UE restarts - you don't need to restart Claude Code when restarting Unreal Engine. The connection will automatically restore once UE is running again.

### Natural Language Commands
Ask Claude:
- "Show me all wall meshes in the ModularOldTown folder"
- "Spawn a cube at location 1000, 500, 0"
- "Take a screenshot of the current viewport"
- "List all actors with 'Door' in their name"
- "Focus the camera on the player start"
- "Check the UE logs for any errors"

### Python Proxy for Advanced Control
```python
# Claude can execute any UE Python API command:
"Use python_proxy to get all actors of type StaticMeshActor"
"Execute Python to change all lights to blue"
"Run Python code to analyze material usage in the level"
```

## üèó Architecture

```
UEMCP bridges AI ‚Üî Unreal Engine:
Claude Desktop ‚Üí MCP Server (Node.js) ‚Üí Python Listener ‚Üí Unreal Engine

Key Features:
- Content-only plugin (no C++ compilation needed)
- Hot reload support for rapid development
- Full access to UE Python API
- Background HTTP listener (non-blocking)
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

### Plugin Development

**Recommended: Use symlinks for hot reloading**

The init script now supports creating symlinks automatically:
```bash
# Install with symlink (recommended for development)
node init.js --project "/path/to/project.uproject" --symlink

# Or let it ask you interactively (defaults to symlink)
node init.js --project "/path/to/project.uproject"
```

Benefits of symlinking:
- ‚úÖ Edit plugin files directly in the git repository
- ‚úÖ Changes reflect immediately after `restart_listener()`
- ‚úÖ No need to copy files back and forth
- ‚úÖ Version control friendly

```bash
# In UE Python console, reload changes without restarting:
restart_listener()  # Hot reload your changes

# Available helpers:
status()            # Check if running
stop_listener()     # Stop listener
start_listener()    # Start listener
```

### Adding New Tools
1. Add command handler in `plugin/Content/Python/uemcp_listener.py`
2. Create MCP tool wrapper in `server/src/tools/`
3. Register tool in `server/src/index.ts`

### Testing
```bash
# Run full test suite (mimics CI)
./test-ci-locally.sh

# Individual tests
npm test              # JavaScript tests
python -m pytest      # Python tests
npm run lint          # Linting
```
